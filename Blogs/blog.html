            <p>
                sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in
                sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.

            <p>
                <span class="text-orange-600 text-2xl">Global Scope</span><br> Global ascope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state
                can access that variable.<br>
                <span class="text-orange-600 text-2xl">Block Scope</span> <br> Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the
                curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only
                allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}. 
                The keywords let and const are used to define block variables.

            <p>
                The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the
                Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such
                an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4">How many way we can get undefined value in js?</h2>
            <p>
                Undefined is a property of the global object. It is one of JavaScript's primitive types.<br>
                When a variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the
                variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not
                returned.
